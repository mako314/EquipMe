Renting and Sharing Platform for Tools and Equipment:

Listings: Users can list the tools and equipment they have available for rent, specifying rental rates, availability, and any additional terms.

Searching and Booking: Users in need of specific tools can search for them on the platform, view available listings, and book the items for a specific duration.

Coordination: The platform would facilitate the coordination of pick-ups or deliveries, ensuring a smooth exchange between the item owner and the renter.







  // if anything can write fetches and such here, will see what needs to be use

  // fetches are usEffect, and need useState

  // May also need to write a single display page for each thing, say a user, owner, and a rental. Won't be too difficult because it'd really just be moving stuff around and copying the display page but making one for user, owner and renter? 

  // The cards I've made should be interesting. Basically If I have reviews I would like to just have some small bits from it exist in their cards. So maybe, review stars? Individual reviews? I have to think about how to write it tbh, I can ask chatgpt to generate fake reviews with a 1-5 star rating and x or y equipment 

  // Not sure If I should do one form to control everything and just have it be conditional, I would like to have a signup for users essentially, like a button to click and sign up

  // I may need a way to make an actual rental agreement, will need to brainstorm this. Along with making a rental agreement, should I allow the displaying of said rental agreement?

  // Think this may be a repeat, but everything seems to be in place? All I require left is a dsiplay page, a HOME PAGE to house all the content also? and a search bar 

  // Tomorrow need to work on properly setting up fetches and the rest is smooth sailing, so basically watch the react video and linking it up and follow that guide
  // Then formik and yup


  // Remove - owners from equipment, what else to remove?
