----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------EQUIPMENT IN ITSELF------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Want to add:

1. Pictures for Equipment, be it an image link or an actual UPLOAD that is tied to their profile somehow?

2. Allow individuals to upload their equipment as a CSV, XML, etc and have pandas read and upload it the way I have done with the seed file.

3. Delivery, along with a radius finder, maybe google maps indiciator on the Product/Equipment display page showing where the equipment is located to help an individual understand (maybe use raidus here too if people do not want to disclose their location online)

4. Deposits, a way to somewhat secure actual serious renters and deter people from taking rental availability. (ADD TO MODELS)

5. Show a rental based on if the Equipment is available or not, meaning everytime a rental agreement gets signed -1 or -x amount of equipment. Have a way to rent more than one piece of equipment, like check the available equipment to the input of how many one would like to rent.
(Basically allowing renting of multiple pieces of equipment, if you need two forklifts, you can rent two forklifts) (THIS MATH MAY NEED TO BE DONE IN FRONT END, EXPERIMENT.)

6. Rental costs, can be per hour, by day, by week, month. Think I will cap it per month
(promotional offers allocation?) (IN MODELS?)

7. Including a calendar and booking dates. Find a way to incorporate a real calendar that has availability, with informing the user of when a delivery could take place, along with notifications of delivery (Order received, enroute, delivered) Allow for notifications of when delivery needs to be returned, these can be custom similar to google calendar notification system is ideal. (MODELS?)

8. Time expiry, meaning if the equipments rental date has passed, and the owner has confirmed the returning of the delivery equipment, the equipment becomes available once again

9. Document uploading
10. Require authorization to post Equipment (proof of ownership)
11. Terms and conditions (basic, but can allow for owners to input their own)

12. When searching and hitting enter, find a way (maybe a search-results page?) that kind of fetches the data and outputs what an individual could be looking for. Could be through the equipment for example, or the owners "partners"


Sometimes text color is bugging on navbar if you move too quickly, need to find a solution for this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------USER IN ITSELF---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Profile page with favorites, possily separate from their actual user profile where owners can check reviews / leave reviews

2. REVIEWS AND COMMENTS, STAR RATING

3. Incorporate their rental agreements in a drop down menu, allow them to select from existing, previous, and possibly future ones.
Individuals should be able to view their rental agreements based on a date format 30-60-90-180-360

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NAVBAR ITSELF--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Reinvented the navbar to actually look nice, included the search bar, added a mobile view and such.
2. So ideally, I want the search to not only be on change, but also an on submit if possible. When the search is submitted it takes one to a search result page that can show them what they're looking for, be it partners, or be it specific equipment.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Rental Agreements ITSELF------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Along with documentation upload, I'd like to make a nice card that reflects on the users dashboard / profile. When clicked it'll populate with the rental agreements that user currently has. Ideally they'd never be able to delete rental agreements (Unless one was submitted incorrectly, a new agreement was reached)

2. I'd like to incorporate a sort of message system for users to discuss with partners about rental agreements.

3. 3 way system:
3.1 Show interest, reach out. 
3.2 After reaching out, discuss, send rental agreement to partner. 
3.3 After partner accepts the rental agreement is formed.


4. Find a way to upload documents to the rental agreement, take deposits in, and from there it can be submitted.
4.1 Both the Renter and the Owner need to have the following:
Proof of renters insurance (Renter)
Proof of Owners equipment insurance (Owner)
Proof of Ownership (Owner) <--This should likely not be visible to the renter, but to a site admin-->

5. Include a created at date, updated at.
