Want to add:

Pictures for Equipment, be it an image link or an actual UPLOAD that is tied to their profile somehow?

Allow individuals to upload their equipment as a CSV, XML, etc and have pandas read and upload it the way I have done with the seed file.

Delivery, along with a radius finder, maybe google maps indiciator on the Product/Equipment display page showing where the equipment is located to help an individual understand (maybe use raidus here too if people do not want to disclose their location online)

Deposits, a way to somewhat secure actual serious renters and deter people from taking rental availability.

Show a rental based on if the Equipment is available or not, meaning everytime a rental agreement gets signed -1 or -x amount of equipment. Have a way to rent more than one piece of equipment, like check the available equipment to the input of how many one would like to rent.
(Basically allowing renting of multiple pieces of equipment, if you need two forklifts, you can rent two forklifts)

Rental costs, can be per hour, by day, by week, month. Think I will cap it per month
(promotional offers allocation?)

Including a calendar and booking dates. Find a way to incorporate a real calendar that has availability, with informing the user of when a delivery could take place, along with notifications of delivery (Order received, enroute, delivered) Allow for notifications of when delivery needs to be returned, these can be custom similar to google calendar notification system is ideal.

Time expiry, meaning if the equipments rental date has passed, and the owner has confirmed the returning of the delivery equipment, the equipment becomes available once again

1. Document uploading
2. Require authorization to post Equipment (proof of ownership)
3. 
4. Terms and conditions (basic, but can allow for owners to input their own)
